## Fundamental Principles

### Caloric Requirements
Your caloric needs will depend on your goals:
- **Muscle building**: Moderate caloric surplus (200-300 calories above maintenance)
- **Fat loss**: Moderate caloric deficit (300-500 calories below maintenance)
- **Maintenance/performance**: Eat at caloric maintenance

### Macronutrient Guidelines

#### Protein
- **Amount**: 1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight daily
- **Purpose**: Muscle repair, recovery, and building
- **Sources**:
  - Lean meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef)
  - Fish and seafood
  - Eggs and egg whites
  - Dairy (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese)
  - Plant-based (tofu, tempeh, legumes, seitan)

#### Carbohydrates
- **Amount**: 3-7g per kg of bodyweight daily (higher for higher activity levels)
- **Purpose**: Energy for workouts, muscle glycogen replenishment
- **Glycogen connection**: Carbs are stored as glycogen in muscles and liver
  - Glycogen is your primary fuel for moderate to high-intensity exercise
  - Adequate carbs ensure optimal glycogen stores for performance
  - Post-workout carbs replenish depleted glycogen stores
- **Best sources**:
  - Whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa)
  - Starchy vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes)
  - Fruits
  - Beans and legumes

#### Fats
- **Amount**: 0.5-1g per kg of bodyweight daily
- **Purpose**: Hormone production, vitamin absorption, joint health
- **Quality sources**:
  - Avocados
  - Nuts and seeds
  - Olive oil
  - Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel)
  - Nut butters

## Meal Timing Strategies

### Pre-Workout Nutrition
- Eat 1-3 hours before training
- **Glycogen focus**: Ensure glycogen stores are topped off for optimal performance
- Focus on carbohydrates with moderate protein
- Keep fat and fiber lower to prevent digestive discomfort
- **Specific recommendations**:
  - 1-4g carbs per kg bodyweight for strength training
  - 1-2g carbs per kg bodyweight for cardio/HIIT
- Example: Oatmeal with banana and a scoop of protein powder

### Post-Workout Nutrition
- Eat within 1-2 hours after training
- **Glycogen replenishment priority**: This is when your muscles are most receptive to glycogen storage
- Prioritize protein and carbohydrates
- **Optimal ratio**: 3:1 or 4:1 carbs to protein for glycogen replenishment
- **Immediate window (0-30 min)**: 1-1.5g carbs per kg bodyweight
- Example: Chicken breast with rice and vegetables or protein shake with fruit

### Daily Meal Structure
- **Option 1**: 3 larger meals and 1-2 snacks
- **Option 2**: 4-6 smaller, evenly spaced meals
- Choose the approach that fits your lifestyle and hunger patterns

## Hydration Guidelines

- Baseline: Minimum 3-4 liters of water daily
- Add 500-1000ml for each hour of exercise
- Signs of proper hydration: Clear to light yellow urine
- Consider electrolyte supplementation during longer workouts

- Ask for sauces/dressings on the side
- Consider skipping alcohol

### Supplement Recommendations
**High priority** (if diet is insufficient):
- Protein powder (whey, casein, plant-based)
- Vitamin D (if limited sun exposure)
- Omega-3 fatty acids (if fish intake is low)

**Optional** (based on individual needs):
- Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily)
- Magnesium (before bed)
- Pre-workout (if needed for energy)

## Adapting Nutrition to Your Goals

### For Building Muscle
- Ensure caloric surplus
- Time carbohydrates around workouts
- Prioritize protein distribution throughout the day
- Focus on recovery nutrition

### For Fat Loss
- Maintain protein intake when cutting calories
- Emphasize nutrient-dense, filling foods
- Consider slight carb cycling (more on training days)
- Be patient and consistent

### For Performance
- Prioritize carbohydrates for fuel
- Focus on pre/post workout nutrition
- Stay well-hydrated
- Eat sufficient calories to support training

Remember that nutrition should be personalized to your individual needs, preferences, and response. Start with these guidelines and adjust based on your progress and how you feel.
