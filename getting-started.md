# Getting Started with a 5-Day Workout Routine

Beginning a 5-day workout routine is an excellent commitment to your health and fitness. This guide will help you prepare properly and start your journey on the right foot.

## Before You Begin

### Medical Clearance
- Consult with a healthcare provider before starting, especially if you have pre-existing conditions
- Discuss any limitations or modifications you might need

### Equipment and Space
- Decide if you'll work out at home or at a gym
- For home workouts: invest in basic equipment (dumbbells, resistance bands, yoga mat)
- Find a dedicated space for your workouts

### Planning and Scheduling
- Block specific times in your calendar for workouts
- Aim for consistency in timing to establish a habit
- Allow 45-60 minutes per session (including warm-up and cool-down)

## Designing Your 5-Day Split

A balanced 5-day routine might look like:
1. **Monday**: Upper body strength
2. **Tuesday**: Lower body strength
3. **Wednesday**: Cardio or active recovery
4. **Thursday**: Push exercises (chest, shoulders, triceps)
5. **Friday**: Pull exercises (back, biceps)
6. **Saturday/Sunday**: Rest and recovery

- **Listen to your body**: Distinguish between good discomfort and pain
- **Track your workouts**: Keep a simple journal of exercises, sets, reps, and weights

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Doing too much too soon
2. Skipping warm-ups and cool-downs
3. Inconsistent scheduling
4. Neglecting proper form
5. Not giving your body enough recovery time
